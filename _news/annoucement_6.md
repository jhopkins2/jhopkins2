I attended SOUPS 2024 and Usenix Security 2024 this past week. I had a blast. I meet many wonderful researchers. I learned a lot from the presentations. I also had the pleasure of presenting a lightning talk at SOUPS 2024. You can watch it with this [link](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2024/presentation/hopkins). If you want to look at slides, here is the [link](https://jhopkins2.github.io/jhopkins2/assets/pdf/10_Hopkins_Lightning_SOUPS24.pdf) to that. Here is a [photo](https://jhopkins2.github.io/jhopkins2/assets/img/SOUPS_presentation.jpg) of my presentation at SOUPS 2024.
