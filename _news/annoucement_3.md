I am thankful to my dissertation advisor, [Dr. Carlos Rubio Medrano](https://carlosrubiomedrano.com/), and my dissertation committee: [Dr. Wenlu Wang](https://wenlu-w.github.io/), [Dr. Medhi Sookhak](https://www.tamucc.edu/files/php/views/faculty-details.php?profile=Mehdi_Sookhak), and [Dr. Tianxing Chu](https://www.tamucc.edu/files/php/views/faculty-details.php?profile=Tianxing_Chu).
