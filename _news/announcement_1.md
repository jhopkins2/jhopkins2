I presented for the first time at [SACMAT](https://www.sacmat.org/2024/program.php) about my work, [SecureCheck](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649158.3657050). I was very nervous going through, but I preserved and I am excited to continue with my work. I look forward to the next I present at SACMAT. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/img/SACMAT_group.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url}}">&#91;Photo&#93;</a> of my advisor, labmates, and I at SACMAT.
